# Guess The Correlation 

This is a basic game made using *matplotlib* and is played by the user putting in raw inputs.

`generate_rnd(n)`

generates *n* random plots. The player has to guess what the correlation of the points in the plot is to 1 decimal place.

# Happy_Numbers

Take a number, square its degits and then sum them. Then repeat the process. If we reach the number 1 then our original number is called a **Happy number**.
If we get a cycle of other numbers, then our number is an **Unhappy number**.

In this notebook we look for happy numbers under a certain limit. 

We also analyse the **digit sums** and **final digit sums** of Happy Numbers.

# Primes and More

A **perfect number** is a number whose factors (including 1) add up to make the original number. 

The smallest perfect number is 6 = 1 + 2 +3.

The purpose of this notebook is to create an attractive plot displaying some beautiful numbers: perfect numbers, **primes** and **triangular numbers**.

# Random Maths

## Amicable Pairs

Amicable pairs are a pair of integers where the factors of each, sum to make the other.

This notebook has quite a bit of random maths but the most exciting part of it is the section that looks for amicable pairs under a given limit.
